            <p> During the start of my junior year, me and 3 of my friends planned to create a high school club called the Coppell Volleyball club. I was named president of the club because I had the most experience playing volleyball. The club would meet every friday to practice for upcoming tournaments held by our school. We also hosted casual tournaments of our own, where people could come to learn, play, and have fun.  </p>`

            <p> I joined Buisness Professionals of America during my junior year of high school. Out of the various projects BPA gave us, I  was intrested in coding with C#. I had won 1st place in regionals and I was one of the qualifiers to the state level. During my stay at state, I learned the etiquttes of a professional environment. Joining this club taught me many qualities like leadership, responsibility, and teamwork.  </p>

We were also tasked with creating a science exhibit which would be displayed in the museum during the July 4th celebration.
